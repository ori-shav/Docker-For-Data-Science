# Docker-For-Data-Science

Docker is rapidly emerging as one of the top tools for bringing efficiency to the work that data science teams—particularly those working in machine learning (ML)—are doing. Creating and developing ML models is often messy. Seasoned data scientists know that different versions of the same software can produce different results. With Docker, you can include the right versions of each needed dependency and library, so no one ever has to do any configuration.

The examples shown are examples for Dev environment for machine learning and data science and Noteboooks and data (.csv file) for sharing data exploration between teams.
